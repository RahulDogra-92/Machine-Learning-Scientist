Suppliers are expected to report any \\nsuspected wrongdoing. The Alight Ethics Helpline or 1- 844-570-4239 is a convenient and anonymous way for Suppliers to \\nreport suspected wrongdoing without fear of retaliation. It is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Alternatively, \\nAppropriate action is taken against those found to have violated applicable law or Alight policy.   \\nTreat people right \\nAlight believes that all workers within our service delivery and supply chain deserve a fair and ethical workplace.

All suppliers to \\nAlight are expected to conduct their business in accordance with the highest standards of ethical behavior and in accordance \\nwith applicable laws and regulations and Alight‚Äôs policies on corporate conduct (‚ÄúSupplier Code‚Äù). This Supplier Code applies \\nto all suppliers and each of their vendors, suppliers, subcontractors and agents providing goods, software, or services directly \\nor indirectly to Alight (each a ‚ÄúSupplier‚Äù).   \\nPolicy Compliance \\nAlight may assess Supplier‚Äôs‚Äô compliance with this Supplier Code, and any violations of this Supplier Code may jeopardize the \\nSupplier‚Äôs business relationship with Alight, up to and including termination.  \\nReporting and the Alight Ethics Helpline   \\nAlight Code of Conduct outlines the ethical standard for Alight employees, officers and directors, contractors, and suppliers \\nas appropriate, and any agents, affiliates, partners or third parties representing Alight. Suppliers are expected to report any \\nsuspected wrongdoing. The Alight Ethics Helpline or 1- 844-570-4239 is a convenient and anonymous way for Suppliers to \\nreport suspected wrongdoing without fear of retaliation. It is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Alternatively, \\nAppropriate action is taken against those found to have violated applicable law or Alight policy.   \\nTreat people right \\nAlight believes that all workers within our service delivery and supply chain deserve a fair and ethical workplace. Suppliers \\nshall uphold these standards: \\nHarassment and discrimination \\nSuppliers must promote a workplace that is free of discrimination in hiring and other employment practices, and not \\ndiscriminate based on any protected status or characteristic. Suppliers will provide a work environment free from any form \\nof harassment or discrimination of any kind, including behavior that is disrespectful, abusive or humiliating on the basis of \\ngender, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, age, disability, pregnancy, veteran status, \\nmarital or domestic partner status or any other status protected by law. \\nDiversity and equal treatment \\nAlight believes that including diverse partners in our business is important to our success.

All suppliers to \\nAlight are expected to conduct their business in accordance with the highest standards of ethical behavior and in accordance \\nwith applicable laws and regulations and Alight‚Äôs policies on corporate conduct (‚ÄúSupplier Code‚Äù). This Supplier Code applies \\nto all suppliers and each of their vendors, suppliers, subcontractors and agents providing goods, software, or services directly \\nor indirectly to Alight (each a ‚ÄúSupplier‚Äù).   \\nPolicy Compliance \\nAlight may assess Supplier‚Äôs‚Äô compliance with this Supplier Code, and any violations of this Supplier Code may jeopardize the \\nSupplier‚Äôs business relationship with Alight, up to and including termination.  \\nReporting and the Alight Ethics Helpline   \\nAlight Code of Conduct outlines the ethical standard for Alight employees, officers and directors, contractors, and suppliers \\nas appropriate, and any agents, affiliates, partners or third parties representing Alight. Suppliers are expected to report any \\nsuspected wrongdoing. The Alight Ethics Helpline or 1- 844-570-4239 is a convenient and anonymous way for Suppliers to \\nreport suspected wrongdoing without fear of retaliation. It is available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Alternatively, \\nAppropriate action is taken against those found to have violated applicable law or Alight policy.   \\nTreat people right \\nAlight believes that all workers within our service delivery and supply chain deserve a fair and ethical workplace. Suppliers \\nshall uphold these standards: \\nHarassment and discrimination \\nSuppliers must promote a workplace that is free of discrimination in hiring and other employment practices, and not \\ndiscriminate based on any protected status or characteristic. Suppliers will provide a work environment free from any form \\nof harassment or discrimination of any kind, including behavior that is disrespectful, abusive or humiliating on the basis of \\ngender, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, age, disability, pregnancy, veteran status, \\nmarital or domestic partner status or any other status protected by law. \\nDiversity and equal treatment \\nAlight believes that including diverse partners in our business is important to our success. We expect our suppliers to identify, \\nadopt, and integrate diversity into their own supply processes and hiring, including equal treatment of minority and women-\\nowned businesses in the supplier selection process. \\nSupplier shall provide equal treatment without regard to any protected status or characteristic in all aspects of Supplier‚Äôs \\nemployment decisions, including: \\n\\uf0b7  Recruitment and hiring  \\n\\uf0b7  Promotion and performance  \\n\\uf0b7  Development and training \\n\\uf0b7  Benefits and compensation \\n\\uf0b7  Termination of employment \\nMaintaining a safe and healthy workplace \\nSuppliers shall provide workers with a safe and healthy workplace that complies with all applicable health and safety laws \\nand regulations. Suppliers must take proactive measures to prevent workplace hazards. This commitment to safety also \\nSupplier Framework Agreement    12 \\n DocuSign Envelope ID: 25339DCA-2B39-4BF3-9BA2-3FBE71D2D9A3\\n \\nmeans that Suppliers must never tolerate any threats or acts of violence, including intimidation, bullying, and attempts to \\ninstill fear in others. \\nHuman rights and labor concerns \\nNo forced or child labor \\nSuppliers shall not engage in or permit forced labor, human trafficking or underage labor. Additionally, Supplier must not \\nemploy or allow employees under 15 years old or the legally required minimum age, whichever is higher. \\nWages \\nSuppliers shall provide wages and benefits that met or exceed local legal requirements and provide them in a timely manner. \\nFreedom of association and collective bargaining \\nSupplier shall respect the rights of its workers to freely choose whether or not to join associations, organizations and trade \\nunions, and to bargain collectively as provided by local law or regulation. \\nFollow the laws and our policies \\nCompliance means not only observing the law, but also conducting corporate business in a way that recognizes and fulfills \\nsocial and ethical responsibilities.  In addition to any specific obligations under the Supplier‚Äôs agreement with Alight, Supplier \\nshall adhere to the following standards: \\nAnti-bribery and anti-corruption laws \\nAlight is committed to compliance with anti-corruption laws in all countries where Alight operates and expects the same of \\nits Suppliers. These laws include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), the U.K. Bribery Act, U.S. fraud statutes, state \\nlaws and similar international rules. The laws prohibit improper payments, such as bribes and kickbacks, or promises to make \\nimproper payments, whether or not the offer is successful. The offering, paying, soliciting or accepting of bribes or kickbacks \\nis strictly prohibited. Supplier shall not make or promise to make an illegal payment or otherwise offer anything of value to \\nany government officials or anyone else for the purpose of securing an improper advantage or to obtain or retain business. \\nFair dealing and marketing practices   \\nAlight competes fairly in the marketplace and abides by fair competition and antitrust laws and expects the same of its \\nSupplier‚Äôs. Supplier shall not enter into any agreements, whether express or implied, that violate the letter or spirit of anti-\\ncompetition laws. In addition, Supplier shall not alter or draft agreements with Alight to conceal or falsify deal terms. We \\nexpect Supplier‚Äô marketing and sales activities on Alight‚Äôs behalf to be ethical.  \\nFinancial crime, anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws \\nSupplier shall comply with the financial crime, anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism laws in all jurisdictions where it does \\nbusiness.

Supplier will not accept funds known to be derived from illegal activities. \\nInternational trade restrictions \\nSupplier shall comply with U.S. trade restriction laws and regulations, including economic sanctions, applicable import/export \\nrules and anti-boycott activities and expects the same of its Suppliers. These import and export laws apply not only to goods \\nbut also to technology, software, intellectual property and technical information. Complying with all applicable international \\ntrade restriction and economic sanctions laws includes never knowingly employing or doing business with anyone suspected \\nof being connected with criminal or terrorist activities or who is subject to economic sanctions. \\nAccepting and giving gifts and entertainment \\nSupplier shall ensure that acceptance of any business courtesies, gifts, or entertainment by any of its personnel is proper and \\nconsistent with the Anti-Corruption rules.

Supplier shall disclose actual or potential conflicts of interest relating to their activities \\nwith Alight.   \\nEnvironmental Responsibility \\nAlight is committed to providing service in a manner that maintains a safe and healthy workplace for our Colleagues and \\nminimizes our potential impact on the environment. Supplier will operate a safe and healthy workplace in an environmentally \\nresponsible and efficient manner to minimize adverse impacts on the environment.
